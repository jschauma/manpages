NAME
     sizeof operator  yield the storage size of the given operand

SYNTAX
     sizeof (type)
     sizeof expression

DESCRIPTION
     The size of primitive data types in C may differ across hardware platforms
     and implementations.  It may be necessary or useful for a program to be
     able to determine at runtime the storage size of a data type or object.

     The unary sizeof operator yields the storage size of an expression or data
     type in char sized units.	As a result, 'sizeof(char)' is always guaranteed
     to be 1.  (The number of bits per char is given by the CHAR_BITS definition
     in the limits.h header.)

EXAMPLES
     The following example illustrate the possible results of calling sizeof on
     an LP64 system:

     When applied to a simple variable or data type, sizeof returns the storage
     size of the data type of the object:

	   Object or type		      Result
	   sizeof(char)			      1
	   sizeof(int)			      4
	   sizeof(float)		      4
	   sizeof(double)		      8
	   sizeof(char *)		      8

     For initialized data or uninitialized arrays of a fixed size known at
     compile time, sizeof will return the correct storage size:

	   #define DATA "1234567890"
	   char buf1[] = "abc";
	   char buf2[1024];
	   char buf3[1024] = { 'a', 'b', 'c' };

	   Object or type		      Result
	   sizeof(DATA)			      11
	   sizeof(buf1)			      4
	   sizeof(buf2)			      1024
	   sizeof(buf23			      1024

     When applied to a struct or union, sizeof returns the total number of units
     in the object, including any internal or trailing padding used to align the
     object in memory.	This result may thus be larger than if the storage size
     of each individual member had been added:

	   struct s1 {
		   char c;
	   }

	   struct s2 {
		   char *s;
		   int i;
	   }

	   struct s3 {
		   char *s;
		   int i;
		   int j;
	   }

	   struct s4 {
		   struct s1 a;
		   struct s2 b;
		   struct s3 c;
	   }

	   Object or type		      Result
	   sizeof(struct s1)		      1
	   sizeof(struct s2)		      16
	   sizeof(struct s3)		      16
	   sizeof(struct s4)		      40

     When applied to a struct containing a flexible array member, sizeof returns
     the size of the struct without the array, although again possibly including
     any padding the compiler deemed appropriate:

	   struct flex {
		   char c;
		   char b;
		   char array[];
	   }

	   Object or type		      Result
	   sizeof(struct flex)		      2

     One of the more common uses of the sizeof operator is to determine the
     correct amount of memory to allocate:

	   int *nums = calloc(512, sizeof(int));

     The sizeof operator can be used to calculate the number of elements in an
     array by dividing the size of the array by the size of one of its elements:

	   int nums[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
	   const int howmany = sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0]);

RESULT
     The result of the sizeof operator is an unsigned integer type, defined in
     the stddef.h header as a size_t.

NOTES
     It is a common mistake to apply sizeof to a dynamically allocated array:

	   char *buf;
	   if ((buf = malloc(BUFSIZ)) == NULL) {
		   perror("malloc");
	   }
	   /* Warning: wrong! */
	   (void)strncat(buf, input, sizeof(buf) - 1);

     In that case, the operator will return the storage size of the pointer
     ('sizeof(char *)'), not the allocated memory!

     sizeof determines the size of the result of the expression given, but does
     not evaluate the expression:

	   int a = 42;
	   printf("%ld - %d\n", sizeof(a = 10), a); /* Result: "4 - 42" */

     Since it is evaluated by the compiler and not the preprocessor, the sizeof
     operator cannot be used in a preprocessor expression.
