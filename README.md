Miscellaneou Manpages
=====================

This repository contains miscellaneous manual pages
that I've found useful to reference, but that have not
been added to any open source operating systems.

To install all manaual pages under `PREFIX`, simply
run `make install`.  `PREFIX` defaults to
`/usr/local`, placing the manual pages into
`/usr/local/share/man`.
